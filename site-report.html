                    Working on this assestment it was a new experience for me as 
                    it was my first time developing a website and using css on a website
                    to build it properly. Building the webiste and debugging was fun as well
                    as fustrating at times. The project gave me the grasp of pros and cons of 
                    using css and html.
                </p> 
                <h1 class="title">Body</h1>
                <p>
                    While building the website the first webpage I built was the home and added the 
                    navigation bar to navigate through different pages. While making the navigation bar
                    I tried to make the elements hover and zoom in but that was not successful as the 
                    whole bar popped up and looked dis-oriented. So, instead I tried text shadow on the nav 
                    bar it turned out well with a different background color so i kept that feature. The navigation 
                    bar was turning out well and i decided to float the elements to right so that I could add a logo 
                    later on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the nav bar I tried to make the portfolio page as it needed columns which was a new tag for me 
                    so I researched the tag and made the portfolio page and added pictures. But, it didn't go as planned as
                    the image didn't align in a proper order so after fixing the width to fitin 3 different images I was satisfied.
                    And the Columns were easy to use. At the starting I only made one css with the plan of doing everything on it
                    but it didn't seemed efficient so for that reason I made css for every page to make it efficiect to find 
                    codes and arrange them. After that 
                </p>
