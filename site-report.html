                        The course Web Development was a really new boundry for me as 
                        it was really focused on html and css previously before bachlor 
                        it was mostly wrote learning and we were forced to remember the code not
                        to really understand them. The classes of web Development was really fun as 
                        the teacher was really interactive and his way of teaching was fun.

                    <h1 class="title">Navigation Bar</h1>
                    <p>
                        While building the website the first webpage I built was the home and added the 
                        navigation bar to navigate through different pages. While making the navigation bar
                        I tried to make the elements hover and zoom in but that was not successful as the 
                        whole bar popped up and looked dis-oriented. So, instead I tried text shadow on the nav 
                        bar it turned out well with a different background color so i kept that feature. The navigation 
                        bar was turning out well and i decided to float the elements to right so that I could add a logo 
                        later on.

                    <p>
                        After the nav bar I tried to make the portfolio page as it needed columns which was a new tag for me 
                        so I researched the tag and made the portfolio page and added pictures. But, it didn't go as planned as
                        the image didn't align in a proper order so after fixing the width to fitin 3 different images I was satisfied.
                        And the Columns were easy to use. At the starting I only made one css with the plan of doing everything on it
                        but it didn't seemed efficient so for that reason I made css for every page to make it efficiect to find 
                        codes and arrange them.

                    <p>
                        After that I tried to make the portfolio pictures responsive. It was annoying as the 
                        css for some reason didn't take pixels less than 4 digit. If I kept the max-width of the screen to 3 digits
                        it wouldn't be responsive so I just kept it on 4 digits and it worked. For the hamburger icon I tried to link it
                        from google but it didnt work so i used the the hamburger from fontawsome and it worked perfectly so I sticked to that.
                        The hamburger icon was easy to put but the navigation bar was not an easy one it was getting confusing so i checked on how to use
                        it and then figured it out so the navigation bar look normal but the elements of the nav bar hit box was plastered to the 
                        right. I just couldn't figure it out so I asked my cousin for help and he helped me. After that we were able to fix
                        that bug.

                        After the responsive hamburger I made the contact us page it was fun to make and the results were satisfiying. Contact us page 
                        has a very pleasant color scheme. Contact page was not as buggy and worked but the 'sumbit' button was not the same it was quite 
                        buggy as the hover scale made it too large  so I decided to make it zoom out(shrink) instead.

                    <p>
                        Since I didn't have any work experience so I had to write some fake one's. So, I chose to write of
                        a waiter, web designer and working at KFC. It was quite easy to make up a fake story as we all have
                        seen waiters serving in resturant and how they get treated as well as KFC and for web designer i made it
                        up from the simple experience I had and basically overstated it.

                    <p>
                        The home page was made really simplistically without much words put onto
                        it. I was lacking inspiration as well as any idea on what to write as it was supposed to
                        be made as the attraction piece. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The color scheme is supposed to be more an the dark theme as the colors I mostly 
                        used are on the dark pallet but some color were bright to attract attention. As the background 
                        color was black I chose purple for as it compliments each other the best. The blue on the nav bar was made to stand out
                        and the color scheme for this page was so that it eould be easy to read but this color is boring too.
