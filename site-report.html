            <div class="column">
                <h1 class="title">Introduction</h1>
                <p>
                    Working on this assestment it was a new experience for me as 
                    it was my first time developing a website and using css on a website
                    to build it properly. Building the webiste and debugging was fun as well
                    as fustrating at times. The project gave me the grasp of pros and cons of 
                    using css and html. Unfortunately I only captured very few images of the website before.
                </p> 
                <h1 class="title">Navigation Bar</h1>
                <p>
                    While building the website the first webpage I built was the home and added the 
                    navigation bar to navigate through different pages. While making the navigation bar
                    I tried to make the elements hover and zoom in but that was not successful as the 
                    whole bar popped up and looked dis-oriented. So, instead I tried text shadow on the nav 
                    bar it turned out well with a different background color so i kept that feature. The navigation 
                    bar was turning out well and i decided to float the elements to right so that I could add a logo 
                    later on.
                </p>
                <h1>Portfolio</h1>
                <p>
                    After the nav bar I tried to make the portfolio page as it needed columns which was a new tag for me 
                    so I researched the tag and made the portfolio page and added pictures. But, it didn't go as planned as
                    the image didn't align in a proper order so after fixing the width to fitin 3 different images I was satisfied.
                    And the Columns were easy to use. At the starting I only made one css with the plan of doing everything on it
                    but it didn't seemed efficient so for that reason I made css for every page to make it efficiect to find 
                    codes and arrange them. 
                </p>
                <h1>Portfolio and Hamburger Responsive</h1>
                <p>
                    After that I tried to make the portfolio pictures responsive. It was annoying as the 
                    css for some reason didn't take pixels less than 4 digit. If I kept the max-width of the screen to 3 digits
                    it wouldn't be responsive so I just kept it on 4 digits and it worked. For the hamburger icon I tried to link it
                    from google but it didnt work so i used the the hamburger from fontawsome and it worked perfectly so I sticked to that.
                    The hamburger icon was easy to put but the navigation bar was not an easy one it was getting confusing so i checked on how to use
                    it and then figured it out so the navigation bar look normal but the elements of the nav bar hit box was plastered to the 
                    right. I just couldn't figure it out so I asked my cousin for help and he helped me and i was able to fix
                    that bug. 
                </p>
                <h1>Contact</h1>
                <p>
                    After the responsive hamburger I made the contact us page it was fun to make and the results were satisfiying. Contact us page 
                    has a very pleasant color scheme. Contact page was not as buggy and worked but the 'sumbit' button was not the same it was quite 
                    buggy as the hover scale made it too large  so I decided to make it zoom out(shrink) instead.
