                <h1>My experience as a Waiter</h1>
                <p>
                    Being a waiter as not as easy as one thinks. It requires great patience 
                    and memory and needs to have great flexebility as well as needs various
                    skills like handeling many plates, drinkes, dishes, etc at a time. Some people may
                    and nag on every little thing but one needs to be clam and respectful 
                    even in those situation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Waiter can't be disrespectful to the customer 
                    as the resturant, hotel, resort, etc rating of services will degrade.
                    But a waiter is a very importent profession on such establishment as the
                    customer mostly interacts with only the waiter and the staff.But,not the chef since 
                    chef already have many things on their hands so the waiter is the face of the establishment.

                <h1>Working as a web designer</h1>
                <p>
                    A web designer needs to be creative and have various knowledge of html, css, php, java script, 
                    etc. Such profession are not seen upfront but a web designer designs the
                    various web pages one uses and are really prominent and a necessary job 
                    since most things are on the web.

                <h1>working at KFC</h1>
                <p>
                    While working at KFC the sheer number of people that came to have food
                    in Nepal shocked me honestly. I didn't expect KFC to be that busy as it 
                    is expensive compared to the average income. People mostly seem to eat at KFC during
                    Holidays as on some holidays there are discounts on the food items.
